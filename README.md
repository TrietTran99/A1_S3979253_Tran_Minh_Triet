You probably clicked on here because it said README.
Right decision, because this README markdown file will help you understand a bit more about this application and how to run it properly.

This is an insurance claim management system, and in order to make this application run all of the files needs to be downloaded.
Please check if all of the files are included:

src is the main folder for the files. 
there should be:
- Claim (class)
- ClaimProcessManager (interface)
- ClaimProcessManagerImplement1 (class)
- Customer (class)
- InsuranceCard (class)
- FileHandler (class)
- Main (class)

Note: Please don't worry about the warnings of each classes, those are just for developers to understand which classes are being used and which aren't.

If you have all of these files already downloaded into your IntelliJ, then in order to run this program you need to click the run button next to the Current File position on your navbar.
